# karyar_projects

This repository is related to the practice projects that I did in Karyar, which I wrote about in order of a few words below:

  1. Seven: This code was my first experience and it's a simple game
     where you have to put the four main operations between the given
     numbers to add up to seven.

  2. As a second experience, I wrote Candy Crush in two versions, the
     first of which may be more clumsy in using functions. I mean Star
     and candy Crash files.

  3. Search It: The third project is a search engine that can find a word
     or phrase both accurately and roughly in a text database.
     
  4. etc
